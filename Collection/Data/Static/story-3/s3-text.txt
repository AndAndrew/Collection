Lake Baikal is a rift lake located in Russia situated in southern Siberia between the federal subjects of Irkutsk 
Oblast to the northwest and Buryatia to the southeast.

With 23,615.39 km3 (5,670 cu mi) of water, Lake Baikal is the world's largest freshwater lake by volume, 
containing 22–23% of the world's fresh surface water, more than all of the North American Great Lakes combined. It 
is the world's deepest lake, with a maximum depth of 1,642 m (5,387 ft), and the world's oldest lake, at 25–30 
million years. At 31,722 km2 (12,248 sq mi)—slightly larger than Belgium—it is the world's seventh-largest lake by 
surface area. It is among the world's clearest lakes.

Baikal is home to thousands of species of plants and animals, many of them endemic to the region. It is also home 
to Buryat tribes, who raise goats, camels, cattle, sheep, and horses on the eastern side of the lake, where the 
mean temperature varies from a winter minimum of −19 °C (−2 °F) to a summer maximum of 14 °C (57 °F).

The region to the east of Lake Baikal is referred to as Transbaikalia or as the Transbaikal, and the loosely 
defined region around the lake itself is sometimes known as Baikalia. UNESCO declared Lake Baikal a World Heritage 
Site in 1996.
